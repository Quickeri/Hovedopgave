This project contains the minimal configuration for a svift.net service/feature

Each service consists of at least one client or server, and possibly both, depending on the service.

This template includes two folders at the root level: client and server. Each of these folders have an "app" child folder; this is where the application specific files are placed. All configuration files/folders should be kept at the root level as siblings to the "app" folder - this is to enforce a strict boundary between application specific files and configuration files.
